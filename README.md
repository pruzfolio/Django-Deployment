# Django Deployment Learning Roadmap

## 1. Beginner Level: Deployment Basics

### Topics:
- [ ] **Preparing Django for Deployment**
  - [ ] Set `DEBUG = False` and configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
  - [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive settings (e.g., `.env` files).
  - [ ] Handle static files (`collectstatic`, `django.contrib.staticfiles`).
  - [ ] Configure the database for production (PostgreSQL recommended).

- [ ] **Deploying on Simple Platforms**
  - **PythonAnywhere:**
    - [ ] Steps:
      - [ ] Create an account and set up a new web app.
      - [ ] Choose Django as the framework and specify Python version.
      - [ ] Upload your Django project via PythonAnywhere's file manager or Git.
      - [ ] Configure the virtual environment and set environment variables.
      - [ ] Run `collectstatic` to serve static files.
      - [ ] Reload the web app.
    - [ ] Features:
      - [ ] No need for manual server configuration.
      - [ ] Simple interface for beginners.

  - **Render:**
    - [ ] Steps:
      - [ ] Sign up and connect your GitHub repository.
      - [ ] Select "Web Service" and specify the build command (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
      - [ ] Add a start command (`gunicorn project_name.wsgi`).
      - [ ] Configure environment variables in the dashboard.
      - [ ] Deploy and test.
    - [ ] Features:
      - [ ] Supports free-tier deployment.
      - [ ] Auto-deploys from GitHub on new commits.

- [ ] **Basic Web Server Knowledge**
  - [ ] Introduction to gunicorn for serving Django apps.
  - [ ] Understanding nginx as a reverse proxy (basic setup).

### Features:
- [ ] PythonAnywhere and Render are excellent for beginners and small projects.

## 2. Intermediate Level: Customization and Flexibility

### Topics:
- [ ] **Server Setup for Django**
  - [ ] Installing and configuring gunicorn and nginx manually.
  - [ ] Setting up PostgreSQL or MySQL in production.
  - [ ] Using `.env` files with `python-decouple` or `django-environ`.

- [ ] **Deploying with Docker**
  - [ ] Writing a Dockerfile for Django.
  - [ ] Using `docker-compose` for multi-container setups (Django, database, nginx).

- [ ] **AWS Deployment**
  - [ ] Deploying on Elastic Beanstalk (simplifies AWS deployments).
  - [ ] Setting up EC2 for manual deployment.
  - [ ] Using RDS for PostgreSQL.

- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**
  - [ ] Using GitHub Actions to automate tests and deployments.
  - [ ] Setting up auto-deployment pipelines for Render or AWS.

### Platform-Specific Deployment:
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:**
  - [ ] Steps:
    - [ ] Install the AWS CLI and configure credentials.
    - [ ] Create a new Elastic Beanstalk environment for Python.
    - [ ] Deploy your Django application using the `eb deploy` command.
    - [ ] Add environment variables in the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard.
    - [ ] Use AWS RDS for the database and S3 for static/media files.
  - [ ] Features:
    - [ ] Managed deployment with scalability options.
    - [ ] Ideal for scaling applications.

- **Docker Deployment:**
  - [ ] Steps:
    - [ ] Create a Dockerfile:
      ```dockerfile
      FROM python:3.10
      WORKDIR /app
      COPY . /app
      RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
      CMD ["gunicorn", "project_name.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
      ```
    - [ ] Build and run the Docker image locally.
    - [ ] Deploy to Docker-based platforms (e.g., Render, AWS ECS).
  - [ ] Features:
    - [ ] Ensures consistency across environments.
    - [ ] Works well with CI/CD.

## 3. Advanced Level: Scaling and High-Performance Deployments

### Topics:
- [ ] **Load Balancing and Scaling**
  - [ ] Using AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer) with multiple EC2 instances.
  - [ ] Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes (EKS, GKE).

- [ ] **Distributed File Storage**
  - [ ] Storing media and static files on AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob.
  - [ ] Configuring Django with `django-storages`.

- [ ] **Database Management**
  - [ ] Setting up read replicas in RDS for high availability.
  - [ ] Optimizing database connections with connection pools.

- [ ] **Serverless Deployments**
  - [ ] Deploying with AWS Lambda using Zappa.
  - [ ] Using Google Cloud Functions or Azure Functions.

- [ ] **Advanced CI/CD**
  - [ ] Using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI for advanced pipelines.
  - [ ] Automating zero-downtime deployments.

### Platform-Specific Deployment:
- **AWS EC2 + RDS + S3:**
  - [ ] Steps:
    - [ ] Launch an EC2 instance and configure security groups.
    - [ ] Install gunicorn and nginx on the instance.
    - [ ] Use RDS for the database and configure Django settings.
    - [ ] Store static and media files on S3.
    - [ ] Use a domain name with Route 53 for custom URLs.
  - [ ] Features:
    - [ ] Full control over the server.
    - [ ] Scalable and customizable.

- **Serverless with AWS Lambda (Zappa):**
  - [ ] Steps:
    - [ ] Install Zappa: `pip install zappa`.
    - [ ] Initialize Zappa: `zappa init` (configure AWS credentials and settings).
    - [ ] Deploy with `zappa deploy`.
    - [ ] Use API Gateway for public access.
  - [ ] Features:
    - [ ] Pay-per-use model reduces costs.
    - [ ] No server management required.
